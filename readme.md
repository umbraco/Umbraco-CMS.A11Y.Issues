## Making Umbraco Accessible
This is the repo for managing accessibility issues for the Umbraco backoffice.

## How to contribute

There are a number of ways you can get involved with helping the Umbraco Accessibility Team, such as;

- Adding Accessibility related issues to the GitHub issue tracker.
- Creating PR's to help fix known (or unknown) accessibility issues.
- Testing the latest version of Umbraco for issues (When we are able to, we carry out a full accessibility audit of the backoffice too).
- Get involved with discussions around, potentially, features and fixes for accessibility issues.

You can find accessibility-related issues that need attention on the [Accessibility Team Issues](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS.Accessibility.Issues/issues) page.

You can also visit our [issue status board](https://github.com/orgs/umbraco/projects/30/views/1) to see the status of each issue

## Membership

Whilst we do have "core" team members, we don't have a limit to how many people can be involved. If you would like to be involved with the core team, please do get in touch. We tend to have discussions on slack and occasional video calls to catch up and discuses progress and next steps every month or so.
